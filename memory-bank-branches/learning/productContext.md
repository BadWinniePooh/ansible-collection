# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

To build a practical, working knowledge of Ansible that can be applied to
real infrastructure automation — starting from zero and progressing to
managing real Hetzner Cloud servers.

## End Goal

A working Ansible project structure capable of:
- Provisioning and configuring Linux servers on Hetzner Cloud
- Managing packages, services, config files, and users
- Securing servers with a hardening playbook
- Keeping secrets safe with Ansible Vault

## Learning Philosophy

- Hands-on over theoretical — every concept is immediately exercised
- Incremental — each iteration builds on the previous
- Prediction-first — learner predicts outcome before running, then verifies
- Version-controlled — every step is committed so progress is always recoverable
