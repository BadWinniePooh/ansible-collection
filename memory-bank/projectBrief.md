# Project Brief

## Purpose

Step-by-step guided learning of Ansible scripting, progressing from fundamentals
to real-world infrastructure automation on Hetzner Cloud.

## Learner Profile

- Complete beginner — no prior Ansible experience
- Runs Windows with WSL2 (Ubuntu 22.04) as the Ansible control node
- Familiar with Git and the command line
- Target environments: Hetzner Cloud (Linux VMs), general Linux server management

## Collaboration Rules

- One focused topic per iteration
- Concepts explained briefly, then hands-on exercise, then checkpoint
- Issues always pointed out immediately — learner decides: "fix it" or "hint me"
- Every completed iteration ends with a git commit (done by GitHub Copilot)
- Git commands run directly in the terminal — never via `wsl --` invocation
- Learner is responsible for `git push`
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits with Co-authored-by footer:
  `Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot <copilot@github.com>`
- Full guidelines: `GUIDELINES.md` in repo root
